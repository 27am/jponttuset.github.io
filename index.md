I am a mathematician, engineer, and PhD in computer vision by [UPC Barcelonatech](http://www.upc.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Ferran Marques](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/ferran).


During those years, I visited [Prof. Jitendra Malik](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~malik/)'s vision group in [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu), and I collaborated with with the startup [Fezoo](http://fezoo.cat).


I am currently doing an internship at [Disney Research, ZÃ¼rich](http://www.disneyresearch.com/research-labs/disney-research-zurich/), under the supervision of [Prof. Aljoscha Smolic](http://zurich.disneyresearch.com/~smolica/).
